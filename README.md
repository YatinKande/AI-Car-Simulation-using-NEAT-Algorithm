AI Car Simulation using NEAT Algorithm 🏎️
===
This project focuses on simulating and optimizing self-driving cars using NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT). The goal is to develop reinforcement learning strategies for cars to navigate complex tracks autonomously while avoiding obstacles. The model evolves through generations to enhance decision-making and adaptability.
## Features
- This project applies NEAT to evolve neural networks via reinforcement learning.

- It includes an obstacle avoidance system using five sensors for real-time data collection.

- Car performance is assessed through a fitness function that tracks collision-free navigation.

- Genetic algorithms help cars evolve by optimizing decision-making over generations.
